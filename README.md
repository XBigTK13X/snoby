A custom client for Emby. Supports library browsing and native playback.

This is a minimalistic client intended only to play media. Use Emby's official client/webapp to manage the instance. I wanted to build this because on a 4K television the built-in player left me wanting. I tried using a number of external players (Kodi, VLC, MX Player) and didn't like that things like Resume would no longer work. Lastly I wanted to improve the subtitle exerience around displaying the ASS format.
