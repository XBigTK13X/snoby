Snowman's ~~Emby~~ Jellyfin

A lot of information, including screenshots, can be found on the [WIKI](https://github.com/XBigTK13X/snowby/wiki).

## Why not use the stock Jellyfin client?

This project started as an alternative desktop client for Emby. I have since moved the underlying server from Emby to Jellyfin. Although Jellyfin has a number of advantages, I still prefer the usability and some of the features in my client.

Originally with Emby, I was unhappy with the audio output and subtitle handling on both the Android and Windows PC clients. Emby server was the best tool for managing a large library of video content, but the players kept causing me annoyances.

My client really only works for my library. If there is a request from someone to make it work on their setup, I am open to making the few small changes necessary to fit with another server instance.
