Snowman's Emby

## Why not use the stock Emby client?

I was unhappy with the audio output and subtitle handling on both the Android and Windows PC Emby clients. Emby server is the best tool for managing a large library of video content, but the players kept causing me annoyances.

My Emby client really only works for my library. If there is a request from someone to make it work on their setup, I am open to making the few small changes necessary to fit with another server instance.

## Why use snowby?

Especially if you are watching 4K UHD content or anime, snowby does it better. It uses a different video player with better subtitle handling and can force Windows 10 into HDR mode depending on the video content.
